            <h2>Dal-Bhat-Tarkari</h2>
            <p>Dal Bhat Recipe from Nepal,
                <br>
                <br>
                Dal Bhat is a quintessential Nepali dish, deeply ingrained in the country's culinary heritage. This
                traditional meal, consisting of lentil soup (dal) and rice (bhat), is a staple for both trekkers and
                locals in the Himalayan region.

                While pressure cookers are commonly used to expedite the cooking process, this recipe takes a more
                traditional approach, providing a rich and authentic experience. The choice of lentils is diverse, but a
                combination of mixed green, red, and black lentils is recommended for optimal flavor and texture.

                As a chef, I encourage flexibility in the kitchen, and this recipe serves as a rough guide, allowing for
                personal interpretation. The use of a blender to grind spices enhances both flavor and color,
                contributing to the overall appeal of the dish.

                Ingredients:
                - Red lentils (masoor dal), mixed lentils (green or brown lentils)
                - Flavorless oil (rapeseed or grapeseed)
                - Onion, finely chopped
                - Crushed garlic
                - Fresh ginger, minced
                - Black mustard seeds, popped in oil
                - Cardamom powder
                - Turmeric powder (or fresh)
                - Cumin seeds
                - Coriander seed
                - Whole peppercorns
                - Cloves
                - Finely chopped tomatoes
                - Butter or ghee (optional, omit for vegan)
                - Coriander leaf and/or green onion or chives, chopped, for garnish
                - Water
                - Sea salt (Himalayan pink salt for authenticity)
                - Pepper to taste
                - Basmati or other rice
                - Indian chutney, curd, a green vegetable, or pickle to serve
                
                Preparation:
                1. Wash and rinse lentils, considering soaking overnight for larger, slower-cooking lentils.
                2. Begin cooking rice separately, using a rice cooker if preferred.
                3. Chop onion, garlic, ginger, and tomatoes.
                4. Heat oil in a large pan, add chopped onion, garlic, and ginger, stirring until golden.
                5. Grind cumin, turmeric, peppercorns, cardamom, and coriander to create a spice mix.
                6. Stir in the spice mix, reduce heat to medium, and cook for 2 minutes, ensuring proper tempering of the spices.
                7. Pop mustard seeds in oil in a hot frying pan, then add to the mix.
                8. Add chopped tomatoes and butter or ghee, stir, cover, and cook for a few minutes.
                9. Incorporate lentils, cooking in oil/butter for 5 minutes, avoiding sticking.
                10. Add water, boil according to lentil cooking instructions, season with salt and pepper.
                11. Wash coriander leaf and/or green onion, chop for garnish.
                
                Serve with rice, popadums, garnish, vegetables, curd, and pickle. The dal is ideally served in a small soup bowl, maintaining its traditional watery soup consistency.
                
                Note: Traditional Dal should have a watery soup consistency; adjust water as needed during cooking.
                 Enjoy this Nepali delight with its rich flavors and cultural significance!
