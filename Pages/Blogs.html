                <p>Dal Chawal is a simple vegetarian meal available in North Indian culture. Therefore there is no direct equivalent English word for ‘Dal chawal’, a Hindustani expression.

                    As against any non-vegetarian food Dal chawal is suggested for vegetarian people..
                    
                    This food contains pulse either from red gram or green gram cooked with spices in liquid form..This preparaion is called as ‘dal’ in Hindustani.
                    
                    Other part of this food is rice..Rice either in raw or cooked form is called as ‘chawal’ in Hindustani..
                    
                    One additional cooked vegetable is an option to ‘dal chawal’ which is called ‘sabji’ in Hindustani.
                    
                    All these food items served as meal in a single go is called ‘dal chawal’..</p>

                <p>“Kidney beans and rice” or “red beans and rice" would be a fair translation of rajma chawal from Hindi, because we Americans (both Americas, North and South) have a similar dish that is basically just kidney beans and rice with a little salt and pepper thrown in for flavor. 
                    
                    Rajma chawal is a bit more specific, of course, because of its more involved spice mixture, but most of us in the USA (especially in the South) would recognize it and call it by their own local term.

                    I have no idea if Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, or Europeans would have a term for it, but we Americans sure do.</p>

                <p>Comfort food is food that provides a nostalgic or sentimental value to someone, and may be characterized by its high caloric nature, high carbohydrate level, or it may be a simple preparation. 
                    
                    The nostalgia may be specific to an individual, or it may apply to a specific culture.

                    We are now citizens of global village, the world has “shrunk”, and we are a single community linked by social media and telecommunication. Due to this food has travelled across cultures & continents.
                    
                    We have array of comfort foods at our disposal which go well beyond dal chawal. We’ve embraced comfort foods of other cultures. It may be Chicken soup or mashed potato or hot chocolate. 
                    
                    I am from India & my comfort food list also includes Penne Pasta tossed in Arrabiata sauce fresh off the pan!</p>

                <p>Dal is often considered to be “lentils” but actually it refers to a split version of a number of lentils, peas, chickpeas & kidney beans etc. If a pulse is split into half, it is a dal. For example, split urad/black gram is known as urad dal.

                    Indian pulses are usually available in three versions: the whole pulse, the split pulse with the skin on the outside, and the split pulse without the skin.
                    
                    The word ‘dal’ denotes a split pulse, but in India it actually includes all dried beans and lentils, as well as dishes in which they are the chief ingredient. 
                    
                    Dals can also include vegetables, sometimes even meat. The critical factor about them is its creaminess. The pulses are simmered for a long time or it is quickly pressure cooked until they collapse into a purée.
                    
                    The tempering or tadka is what completes a dal. Every part of India has its own set of flavourings & tempering.
                    
                    Here I have a few dals to showcase from my kitchen with their English names & Hindi names in bracket. I hope this will help you to not get confused with the names & their types.</p>
